# This repository contains supporting materials (data/codes) for the manuscript "NMR metabolomic modelling of age and lifespan: a multi-cohort analysis"
# Statistical models of biological age were generated in R using NMR metabolomics data. These models may be applied to new NMR metabolomics (Brainshake Ltd./Nightingale HealthÂ©) datasets by other researchers
